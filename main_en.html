My first experience in coding was 6 years age when I was accepted in Code for Palestine program. It is a program that takes 20 high-quality  school students after they go through  English, Math and technology assessment tests and be interviewed; start teaching them design thinking,leadership skills and programming for three years of creating games ,websites and mobile apps.
After i had finished the program, I started problem solving and keeping on being up-to-date with algorithms and new technologies from online platforms such as Codeforces ,AtCode and CSES,
then I took a step to enter  international contests such as ACM and googleHashcode.<br>
